## General info

This is a full-stack web app built with ReactJs and Nodejs with Express framework.

I used Google Sheets as database to bring a lot of convenience for the client. Because adding or removing data from the Sheets app on smartphone is easy while it is secure.

I built this website from scratch including the design. The biggest challenge was creating a robust double language website. I used my own algorithm to achieve this! Also smooth page animation was something that I came up with without using any libraries.

There are still a few features that I would like to add. You can see track of these below.

## Technologies

* JavaScript with ReactJs.
* NodeJs (expressJS)
* Google Sheets (as databaase)

## Application Features

* __Contact form__: With [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) package (using Gmail)
* __Show client's data__: Nodejs in the backend will retrieve the data from Google Sheets, organise them based on dates when necessary and deliver it to front-end.

### To-do list:

- [x] Smooth transition once the page has retrieved data
- [x] Smooth transition on page navigation
- [x] A shake effect when user clicks on a page which he/she is already in, similar to facebook.
- [ ] Create a link tree for client's instagram page, so there won't be a need for using paid services.
- [ ] Show a pop up message when there is an upcoming show in the next few days.
- [ ] Send a gentle reminder for upcoming gigs(on chosen gig) or send a reminder for any upcoming gig. This would be as an email message where users can unsbuscribe from at anytime.
